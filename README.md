# Kalooki
A card game about making sets.

Rules:
Kalooki is a card game with 7 rounds based on making sets.
The rounds are 33, 34, 44, 333, 334, 344, and 444.
From an original deal of 12 cards, in each round a set of 3's (a book) or a set of 4's (a run) must be created.
A run has a quantity of 4 or more cards all from the same family/suit with the value in numerical order.
For example, a run could be: 2 of clubs, 3 of clubs, 4 of clubs, 5 of clubs.
A book has a quantity of 3 or more cards that can be from the same family/suit or a different one in which the value is the same.
For example, a book could be: 2 of clubs, 2 of diamonds, 2 of spades, 2 of hearts.
Any set can have a joker as a replacement of one card not present.
There are only 4 Jokers in the deck and you cannot discard a Joker.
A Joker is worth 50 points.
An Ace of Clubs and an Ace of Spades are worth 15 points. AKA 1 of clubs, 1 of Spades
Each player is alloted 3 calls.
During each turn, the player may take a card from the pile or from the deck.
Immediately after, the player must drop any one card from their own hand or a card they just picked up from the deck.
However, you cannot discard a card you picked up from the discard pile immediately after, you have to wait until the next go around.
When a player has created all the sets, they can 'go down' by dropping the cards accordingly of the round.
A round is over once a player has no cards left, and therefore 'bends' the other players.
Overall, the goal of the game is to have the least amount of points by the final round 444.
The player with the least amount of points by 444 is the winner.
